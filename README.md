# EduApp

This is a prototype which we will be using for rural education so that the students there can easily understand the concepts and relate it with their day to day life. 

We are giving them the most relatable examples so that they can relate the theoritical concepts with their day to day life experiences. Also we have depicted the concepts in real world through the concept of Augmented Reality.
